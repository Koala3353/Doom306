Greetings! As an experienced Discord bot developer with a proven track record of over 30 successful projects, I'm here to offer my services to create a custom bot that will meet your server's specific needs.<p>
My skills and expertise include developing bots with features such as auto-translation, moderation, currency, ticket and logging management, music with voice-related capabilities, web scraping, API interaction, RPG, and database implementation. My bots are designed to perform exceptionally and cater to your server's unique requirements.<p>
My latest project was developed for TRF, a highly active and growing server. I'm proud to say that the bot I created has been received with great enthusiasm and is being used daily by many of the server's members.<p>
When you order a bot from me, you can expect:
- Personalization to your precise specifications
- Complimentary bug fixes and minor changes
- Use of cutting-edge features such as slash commands, context menus, buttons, threads, modals, and auto-complete
- High performance and reliability
- Optional hosting starting at $3 per month<p>
  
Payment is accepted via PayPal or cryptocurrency. My prices typically range from $50 to $250 (although in rare cases it reaches up to $600), depending on the complexity and estimated development time of the bot. I'll be happy to provide you with a quote once we've discussed your requirements.<p>
